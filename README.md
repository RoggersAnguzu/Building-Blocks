# Logic Gates Simulation

This repository contains Arduino code for simulating NAND, AND, and OR gates using Tinkercad. These simple digital logic gates are fundamental building blocks of digital circuits and are widely used in various electronic applications.

## NAND Gate

The NAND gate is a universal gate, which means it can be used to implement any other logic gate. In this simulation, the NAND gate is implemented using Arduino code to demonstrate its behavior. The code reads two input signals and produces the output based on the NAND gate truth table.

## AND Gate

The AND gate is another fundamental logic gate that outputs HIGH (1) only when both of its inputs are HIGH. The repository includes code to simulate the AND gate, which reads two input signals and produces the output based on the AND gate truth table.

## OR Gate

The OR gate is a logic gate that outputs HIGH (1) when at least one of its inputs is HIGH. The simulation code for the OR gate is included in this repository. It reads two input signals and produces the output based on the OR gate truth table.

## Usage

To simulate these logic gates in Tinkercad or on your Arduino hardware, follow these steps:

1. Connect the input pins (e.g., pins 2 and 4) to your input signals.

2. Connect the output pin (e.g., pin 7) to the output device or an LED to observe the gate's behavior.

3. Upload the corresponding Arduino code (NAND_gate.ino, AND_gate.ino, OR_gate.ino) to your Arduino board.

4. Open the Serial Monitor to observe the input states (HIGH or LOW) and the resulting output.

Feel free to modify the code or experiment with different input combinations to understand how these logic gates work.

**Note:** Ensure you have the necessary Arduino libraries and hardware connections set up according to your specific configuration.
